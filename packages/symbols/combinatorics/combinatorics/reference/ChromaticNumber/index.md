signature: ChromaticNumber(graph)
summary: The fewest colors for the vertices so that adjacent vertices differ.
---

- Defined over `LabeledGraph` as an expression in `_x`, evaluated by compute-engine — the definition IS the implementation.
- Takes a `LabeledGraph` and nothing else — it reads values against their positions, or walks the orbits, so it needs the bijection. Applying it to a bare list is a type error, not a wrong answer.
- FindStat's St000098. The colorings in k colors are counted as the covers of the vertices by k independent sets, Σ over the subsets S of (-1)^(n - |S|) i(S)^k with i(S) the independent sets inside S, and the number is the least k with one. The graph with no vertices gives 0.
